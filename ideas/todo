- maybe call optimal narrowing/filtering, instead of narrowing
- Have better explanation for getting best word for narrowing
- ⁠fix height of tree
- ⁠have results for percentage solved in n guesses (n in [6])
- ⁠have running time for building tree



- test entropy instead of average score when obtaining best guess for decision tree
