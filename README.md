**A Polytime and Interpretable Approach for Solving Wordle**   
Igor Lucindo, Gabriel Teodoro, Hamidreza Validi

We implement a **decision tree-based solver** for the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) to minimize the **expected number of guesses** while ensuring correctness. We explore both **normal** and **hard** modes, quantifying the trade-offs between strict constraint satisfaction (hard mode) and the freedom to choose information-maximizing probes (normal mode).

## 📊 Key Results

We evaluated our "Subtree Look-ahead" strategy against the official Wordle dataset (2,315 possible target words). All experiments were conducted on an Intel Core i7-9800X CPU and NVIDIA RTX A2000 GPU.

The word lists used for the target words and valid guesses are located in the `dataset/` folder.

### 1) Best Starting Words

The choice of the first word significantly impacts the game's trajectory. Our solver identified the following openers as mathematically efficient for minimizing expected guesses:

| Rank | Normal Mode | Exp. Guesses | Hard Mode | Exp. Guesses |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **1** | `SALET` | **3.421** | `SALET` | **3.506** |
| **2** | `REAST` | 3.423 | `SLATE` | 3.510 |
| **3** | `SLATE` | 3.425 | `TRACE` | 3.512 |
| **4** | `TRACE` | 3.426 | `REAST` | 3.514 |

> **Note:** Our result of **3.421** guesses for normal mode matches the theoretical optimum reported by exact dynamic programming approaches (Bertsimas et al., 2025), but is achieved using a significantly faster polynomial-time heuristic.

### 2) Performance by Metric

We compared a baseline greedy strategy ("Avg. Size") against our optimized look-ahead strategies. The **Subtree (Top 10)** approach yields results virtually identical to an exhaustive search (**Subtree All**) but with drastically lower computational cost.

| Strategy | Mode | Exp. Guesses | Std. Guesses | Max. Guesses | Build Time (s) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Avg. Size** | Normal | 3.435 | 0.627 | 6 | 14.790 |
| | Hard | 3.531 | 0.790 | 8 | 1.337 |
| **Subtree** (Top 10) | Normal | **3.421** | 0.588 | **5** | 256.700 |
| | Hard | 3.507 | 0.716 | 7 | 14.194 |
| **Subtree** (All) | Normal | **3.421** | 0.588 | **5** | $4.335 \times 10^5$ |
| | Hard | **3.506** | 0.720 | **7** | $1.522 \times 10^4$ |

### 3) Guess Distribution

We analyzed the stability of our heuristic by plotting the distribution of guesses required to solve all 2,315 words.
* **Consistency:** In normal Mode, **100%** of games are solved within 5 guesses. hard mode is nearly as robust, solving **99.9%** of instances within the standard 6-guess limit.
* **Reliability:** Over **98%** of games are solved within 4 guesses in normal mode, while hard mode solves over **93%** within the same window.

> **Right:** Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) showing the total percentage solved within $k$ guesses.

### 4) GPU Acceleration

To address the computational cost of look-ahead search (normal mode), we implemented a parallelized GPU solver.

* **Exhaustive Search (Subtree All):** Reduced build time from **~120 hours** (CPU) to **8.3 hours** (GPU), a **93.1% reduction**.
* **Optimized Search (Subtree Top 10):** Reduced build time from **~4.3 minutes** (CPU) to just **20.6 seconds** (GPU), enabling near real-time decision tree construction.
